# Blackwidow control
Python script to enable macro keys of BlackWidow keyboard under GNU/Linux

It just enables the macro keys which can then be configured as hotkeys in your desktop environment. However it does not enable the ability to record macros and to switch between different configurations like the Windows driver does.

This script has only been tested with the regular edition of the keyboard (the cheapest version which has no background light) using the firmware update from Razer Synapse 2.0. Hence the script might not work with other editions/firmware versions.

## Instructions
Pyusb is required to run the script.
The repository PKGBUILDs (also on my GitHub page) contains files for building an Arch Linux package.
